I am interested in universal machines for information storage and manipulation. Among other things. To be a bit more specific, I dabble in systems administration, security and programming. I try to help other people.

Buy me [stuff](https://amzn.com/w/23WE353M6O53S) if you want to make me happy :-). I also take some [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.

And some of my (free time) software projects:
