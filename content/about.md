I am interested in universal machines for information storage and manipulation :-). Among other things. To be a bit more specific, I dabble in systems administration, security and programming. I try to be nice to people. I like sports, books and languages.

I log some of the technical activities I [have done](https://github.com/jreisinger/have-done).
