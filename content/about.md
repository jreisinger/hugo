I am interested in universal machines for information storage and manipulation - īnstrūmenta computatorium. How do they work and how to make them useful. I dabble in the fields of systems administration, SRE, DevOps, security and programming. Among other things. Buy me [stuff](https://amzn.com/w/23WE353M6O53S) if you want to make me happy :-). I take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.
