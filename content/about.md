I am interested in universal machines that manipulate information under the control of a changeable program. How do they work (especially the changeable programs) and how to make them useful. I dabble in the fields of systems administration (SRE, DevOps) and programming. Among other things. Buy me [stuff](https://amzn.com/w/23WE353M6O53S) if you want to make me happy :-). I take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.
