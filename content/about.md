I am interested in universal machines for information storage and manipulation - īnstrūmenta computatorium. Among other things. How do they work and how to make them useful. I dabble in systems administration (SRE, DevOps), security and programming. Buy me [stuff](https://amzn.com/w/23WE353M6O53S) if you want to make me happy :-). I take [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jozrei) from time to time.
